#summary Introduction to GWT Dojo Mobile

= Introduction =

The Dojo Mobile package (dojox/mobile) provides a number of widgets that can be used to build applications for mobile devices such as iPhone, Android, or BlackBerry. These widgets work best with WebKit-based browsers, such as Safari or Chrome, since WebKit-specific CSS3 features are extensively used. However, a compatibility module (dojox/mobile/compat), is available, which simulates some of the CSS3 features used, even on non-CSS3 browsers. 

Dojo Mobile is designed to be as lightweight as possible. It only has a few dependencies on other dojo modules. Also it has its own very small parser that is a subset of the core dojo.parser, but has enough capability to bootstrap your application.

A sample GWT Dojo Mobile Application can be found at:

https://code.google.com/p/gwt-dojo-toolkit/source/browse/branches/gwt-dojo-toolkit-mobile/

Please use that as a skeleton application for this tutorial. 

Just do:

{{{
svn -co http://gwt-dojo-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/gwt-dojo-toolkit-mobile/ gwt-dojo-toolkit-mobile
}}}

and add it to eclipse.

Like any web application, it's important that the structure of the HTML page is intelligently designed. Important to include are:

  * The proper DOCTYPE
  * Mobile-specific META tags (see: [http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html Mobile Safari Supported Meta Tags])
  * A BODY element which will contain the views
