The Dojo Mobile package (dojox/mobile) provides a number of widgets that can be used to build applications for mobile devices such as iPhone, Android, or BlackBerry. These widgets work best with WebKit-based browsers, such as Safari or Chrome, since WebKit-specific CSS3 features are extensively used.
