#summary Layout with Dijit.

= Introduction =

Creating dynamic and interactive layouts is a challenge common to any graphical user interface. We have a lot of ability to create layout with HTML and CSS. Where CSS leaves off, Dojo picks up with a set of extensible widgets as a part of Dijit - Dojo's UI framework. In this tutorial, we'll explain how Dijit addresses common layout needs and see how easy it can be to create even complex layouts with just a few flexible widgets.

= Getting Started =

You can manage layout of the entire page, or just a small part of it. For this tutorial, we'll be developing a desktop application-like UI layout, with some controls and content being fixed on the page.
